                    <h3>Subshare</h3>
                    <p>Subshare is your share of Subscription Revenue and as the fastest growth area in music our platform allows you the user to be involved and rewarded for the actual value your media or service is bringing the track. Our next generation contract allows you to directly collaborate with others and agree a percentage share in relation to the VALUE it brings to that composition. The contract allows royalties to be collected for you, then you receive a payout for your percentage royalty within the project that got streamed whilst retaining all your rights to media. The Future is here and people that contribute in tracks (similar of feat.) or even just suggest media can now be integral to the success of a hit record.
